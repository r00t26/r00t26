title: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol - HTTP
---

**HTTP** (**Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol**) is a stateless layer 7 (*application layer*) protocol that operates on **port 80** and primarily utilises TCP. 
HTTP is basically a set of rules that are used to govern communication with web servers for exchanging web page data, like HTML, images, videos, etc.
HTTP was developed between 1989-1991 by Tim Berners-Lee.
<br>

**Note:** Stateless means that HTTP does not keep track of previous requests. For this we use cookies, which I explain later in this post.

<br>
While HTTP operates over TCP by default, there are cases where alternative protocols might be used. For instance, **HTTP/3** introduces the use of **QUIC** (***Quick UDP Internet Connections***), which uses UDP for improved performance, especially in situations where latency is a concern. However, this is a relatively new development and not as commonly used as traditional HTTP over TCP.
<br><br>
While HTTP is functionally suitable, the biggest issue with it is the fact that it is a plain-text protocol, making it insecure. There is no data encryption technique being employed with HTTP.
<br><br>
This makes HTTP susceptible to a number of attacks, such as the following two:
<br>
- ***Eavesdropping*** (Sniffing): Attackers can intercept and capture unencrypted HTTP traffic using techniques like packet sniffing. This allows them to view sensitive information, such as login credentials or personal data. Eavesdropping is a passive form of interception where an attacker simply listens in on a communication between two parties without their knowledge or consent.
<br>
- ***Man-in-the-Middle*** (MitM) Attack: Attackers can position themselves between the client and server, intercepting and potentially altering the data exchanged between them. A Man-in-the-Middle attack is an active form of interception where an attacker secretly inserts themselves between two parties engaged in communication.
<br>

HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. HTTP implements rules that are used to govern communication with web servers. And though it serves its purpose well, it does not implement any data encryption, making it susceptible to a number of attacks.

## HTTP(S)

**HTTPS** (*Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol* ***Secure***) is an extension to the HTTP protocol, and it introduced the use of **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** encryption -*an asymmetric encryption algorithm that relies on the use of private keys and public keys*- and later TLS encryption. SSL was developed by Netscape Communications in the mid-1990s to provide a secure way to transmit data over the internet. 
<br><br>
As SSL became widely adopted, concerns arose about its security vulnerabilities. In response, the Internet Engineering Task Force (**IETF**) developed **TLS** (***Transport Layer Security***), which was first published in 1999. TLS is an improved and more secure successor to SSL. TLS provides a more robust protocol for securing online communications and provides stronger cryptographic algorithms and security measures. 
<br><br>
HTTP operates on port 80 as you may recall, whereas HTTPS operates on **port 443**.
<br>

**Note:** It's important to understand that HTTPS is essentially an extension of the HTTP protocol. While certain core principles, such as the ones I discuss here, including status codes and HTTP methods, persist across both HTTP and HTTPS, you might notice references to "*HTTP status codes*" even when talking about HTTPS. This continuity is due to the standardized nature of these elements, which apply to both protocols. In various instances, people use '*HTTP methods*' as a general term to encompass both HTTP and HTTPS. This approach maintains consistency while recognizing that the methods themselves are standardized and shared between the two protocols.

## HTTP Request Methods 

HTTP uses what are known as "**request methods**".
<br><br>
Fundamentally, HTTP request methods serve as a means for clients to express their specific intentions when sending a request to a server over the HTTP protocol. These methods delineate the exact nature of the desired action, whether it involves retrieving data, submitting information, updating resources, or other interactions with the server.
<br><br>
Most common HTTP request methods include:
<br><br>
**GET Request** -> This is used for retrieving information from the web server.
<br>
**CONNECT Request** -> Used to establish a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
<br>
**POST Request** -> This is used for submitting data to the web server, and creating new records.
<br>
**PUT Request** -> This is used for submitting data to a web server to update information.
<br>
**DELETE Request** -> This is used for deleting information/records from the web server.
<br><br>
You can read more about different HTTP methods [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).
<br>

## HTTP Status Codes

When we make a HTTP request to a web server, such as a GET request, we need to be able to know whether or not that request succeeded. For this purpose we use HTTP status codes - to indicate the result of our request.
<br><br>
HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that are sent by a web server to a client as part of the server's response to an HTTP request made by the client. These codes provide information about the outcome of the request and indicate how the server is handling the request or any issues that might have occurred. 
<br><br>
Each status code falls into one of five categories:
<br>
1. **Informational** (*1xx*): These codes indicate that the server is continuing to process the request but needs more time or input from the client before it can provide a final response.
<br>
2. **Successful** (*2xx*): These codes signify that the server has successfully processed the request and is sending back the requested resource or performing the requested action.
<br>
3. **Redirection** (*3xx*): These codes indicate that the client needs to take additional action to complete the request, often involving redirection to a different URL.
<br>
4. **Client Error** (*4xx*): These codes indicate that there was an error on the client's side, such as a malformed request or unauthorized access to a resource.
<br>
5. **Server Error** (*5xx*): These codes indicate that there was an error on the server's side, typically due to server misconfiguration or issues.
<br>

There are many status codes to learn, however knowing the most common ones is a great start. This includes:
<br>
- **200** (OK): This means that the request was successful.
- **201** (Created): The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.
- **301** (Moved Permanently): The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
- **302** (Found) or 303 (See Other): The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location.
- **400** (Bad Request): The server couldn't understand the reqeust due to a client error or malformed request.
- **401** (Unauthorized): The client must authenticate itself to get access to the resource.
- **403** (Forbidden): The client does not have permission to access the resource.
- **404** (Not Found): **We've all seen this one!** It means the requested resource could not be found.
<br>

Those are just some examples of HTTP status codes. There are many more that you can encounter.
<br>

## Cookies

**Cookies** were initially introduced as a solution to a practical problem: the statelessness of the HTTP protocol (*as I already mentioned before*). When the World Wide Web was first being developed, the HTTP protocol was designed to be stateless, meaning that each request made by a user's browser to a web server was independent and didn't carry any information about previous interactions. This design simplified the architecture of the web, but it also posed challenges for maintaining user sessions and personalization. And so, cookies were invented by Internet pioneer Lou Montulli in 1994 to provide a solution to this problem.
<br><br>
Cookies are pieces of data sent by a web server to a user's web browser and then stored on the user's device.. These cookies are later sent back to the server with subsequent requests from the user, allowing the server to remember and recognize the user's previous requests.  
<br>
Here are some reasons why cookies are helpful:
<br>
- **Session Management**: Cookies can be used to manage user sessions. When a user logs in to a website, a session cookie can be used to keep them logged in.
<br>
- **Personalization**: Cookies enable websites to remember user preferences and provide a personalized experience. For instance, a website might remember your font size preference.
<br>
- **Tracking and Analytics**: Cookies can be used to gather information about user behavior. For instance, how long they stay on a page, and what actions they take.
<br>
- **Ad Targeting**: Cookies are used for targeted advertising. Advertisers can use cookies to track users' interests and display relevant ads based on their browsing history.
<br>

While cookies are a very common method for managing user sessions and authentication, there are alternative approaches, such as using tokens in the URL or in the request headers, to achieve *similar* functionality. However, these approaches often have their own limitations and security concerns, which is why cookies have remained a widely adopted and preferred method for implementing login functionality on websites.
<br><br>
Here is a very basic overview of how cookies work.
<br><br>
Once a user visits a website, the server will send a cookie to the user, which will contain information such as a unique identifier, expiry date, and other data.
That cookie will be associated with the domain of the website that sent it, and will be stored locally on the user's computer. From here, for every subsequent request to the web server, the browser will automatically include the cookie in the HTTP request, allowing the web server to read and process the cookie data.

## Conclusion

HTTP, or Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol, serves as the backbone of web communication. It operates at the application layer, using TCP on port 80. Essentially, HTTP comprises a set of rules governing interactions between clients and web servers, facilitating the exchange of web page content. This foundational protocol, conceived by Tim Berners-Lee between 1989-1991, possesses a critical trait: statelessness. This means it doesn't retain information about previous interactions, necessitating the use of cookies for session management.
<br><br>
However, HTTP's Achilles' heel is its lack of data encryption, rendering it vulnerable to various security threats. Eavesdropping, wherein attackers intercept unencrypted HTTP traffic, and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where malicious actors secretly meddle with data exchange between clients and servers, are prime examples.
<br><br>
To address these security concerns, HTTPS, or Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure, emerged as an extension of HTTP. HTTPS introduces SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and later TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption techniques, safeguarding data in transit. HTTPS operates on port 443.
<br><br>
HTTP encompasses various request methods that enable clients to specify their intentions when communicating with servers. These methods, including GET, CONNECT, POST, PUT, and DELETE, dictate actions like retrieving, submitting, updating, or deleting data.
<br><br>
HTTP status codes play a pivotal role in communication. These three-digit numbers, categorized into informational, successful, redirection, client error, and server error codes, indicate the outcome of a client's request. Familiar codes like 200 (OK), 301 (Moved Permanently), and 404 (Not Found) provide insights into the request's success or failure.
<br><br>
Cookies, introduced in 1994, address HTTP's statelessness. They are small data pieces sent from a web server to a user's browser, stored locally and returned with subsequent requests. Cookies serve multiple purposes, including session management, personalization, tracking and analytics, and ad targeting. While alternative methods exist, cookies remain a preferred choice due to their wide adoption and effectiveness in managing user sessions.
<br><br>
In summary, HTTP forms the foundation of web communication, while HTTPS enhances security through encryption. HTTP status codes convey request outcomes, and cookies mitigate the challenges posed by HTTP's statelessness, ensuring a more dynamic and personalized web experience.
