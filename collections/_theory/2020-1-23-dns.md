title: Domain Name System - DNS
---

Domain Name System (***DNS***) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system used to make forward and reverse DNS lookups. Or, more simply, it is used to resolve a name to an IP address, and vice versa.
<br><br>
This is what allows us to use simple names like r00t26.com when accessing websites and web apps, instead of using complex IP addresses. 
<br><br>
DNS operates on **port 53**, mainly using **UDP**. DNS uses TCP for zone transfers, and UDP for DNS queries (*e.g forward and reverse lookups*). UDP can be used to exchange relatively small bits of information, whereas ***TCP must be used to exchange information that is larger than 512 bytes***. TCP is chosen for zone transfers because it provides features like error-checking, reliability, and the ability to handle larger data payloads, which are important for ensuring accurate and complete synchronization of DNS data between servers.
<br><br>
When resolving domain names and IP addresses, DNS uses two types of queries or "lookups", as seen below.
<br><br>
**Forward DNS lookup** resolves a name to an IP address.
<br>
**Reverse DNS lookup** resolves an IP address to a name.
<br>

## Domain Hierarchy
The domain hierarchy is employed to arrange the components of a domain name based on their level of significance.
<br><br>

<br><br>
A **TLD** (Top-Level Domain) is the right part of a domain name, for example in r00t26.com, **.com** is a TLD. 
<br><br>
There are two types of TLDs:
<br><br>
**gTLD** (Generic Top-Level Domain) -> Tells the user the domains purpose, e.g. ***.com*** is for commercial, ***.gov*** for governmental, ***.edu*** for education, ***.org*** for organisational, etc.
<br>
**ccTLD** (Country Code Top-Level Domain) -> Used for geographical purposes. ***.ca*** is for Canada, ***.sk*** for Slovakia, ***.co.uk*** for the United Kingdom, ***.ru*** for Russia, etc.
<br><br>
A top-level domain was intended to help classify a feature of a website, like its purpose, or geographical origin. It also multiplies the number of available domain names, because r00t26.com is **not the same** as r00t26.org. Nowadays, websites have all sorts of TLD's irregardless of their intended purpose.
<br><br>
**Second-Level domain** (SLD) is whatever you want it to be, assuming it has not been taken. This is where you insert your website name, or whatever you want your domain name to be called. For example, in r00t26.com, **r00t26** is the second-level domain. Your domain name can contain the letters a-z, and the digits 0-9. Hyphens can be used but they cannot be used at the beginning and at the end of a domain name. 
<br><br>
The **subdomain** sits on the left-hand side of the Second-Level Domain, using a period to separate them. For instance, in **contact.r00t26.com**. The ‘contact’ is the subdomain. You can have multiple subdomains. Subdomains help split your website into multiple sections if you will. Developers typically use subdomains to help manage extensive sections that require their own content hierarchy.
Interestingly, **www** is a subdomain, usually containing a website’s homepage.
<br>

## How DNS Works

**1.** **User Query**: When a user enters a domain name in their browser (e.g., r00t26.com), their device needs to find the corresponding IP address to connect to the server hosting that website.
<br>
**2.** **Local Cache**: The device first checks its local DNS cache to see if it already knows the IP address for the domain. If the information is cached and not expired, it can be used directly.
<br>
**3.** **Recursive DNS Resolver**: If the IP address is not in the local cache, the device contacts a recursive DNS resolver (also known as a DNS resolver). This resolver is typically provided by the user's Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a third-party DNS service.
<br>
**4.** **Root DNS Servers**: If the resolver doesn't have the IP address, it starts a DNS resolution process by querying the root DNS servers. These servers are at the top of the DNS hierarchy and hold information about the authoritative DNS servers for top-level domains like ".com," ".org," etc.
<br>
**5.** **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers**: The root server directs the resolver to the appropriate TLD DNS servers. These servers handle information for domain extensions like ".com" or ".org."
<br>
**6.** **Authoritative DNS Servers**: The TLD servers provide the IP address of the authoritative DNS servers responsible for the specific domain (e.g., "example.com").
<br>
**7.** **Querying Authoritative Servers**: The resolver queries the authoritative DNS server for "example.com." This server holds the actual DNS records for the domain.
<br>
**8.** **DNS Records**: The authoritative server responds with the relevant DNS records, including the "A" record that contains the IP address associated with the domain name.
<br>
**9.** **Caching**: The resolver stores the received information in its cache for future use, reducing the need for repeated lookups.
<br>
**10.** **Response to User**: The resolver sends the IP address back to the user's device, enabling it to establish a connection with the server hosting the website.
<br>

## DNS Record Types

DNS also uses various records. The intended purpose of DNS records is to provide the necessary information for translating human-readable domain names into corresponding IP addresses or other data types.
<br><br>
Below you can find some examples of DNS record types.
    <br><br>
    - **A** Record (Address Record): Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
    <br>
    - **AAAA** Record: Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
    <br>
    - **CNAME** Record (Canonical Name): Creates an alias for a domain name, pointing to another domain name.
    <br>
    - **MX** Record (Mail Exchange): Specifies mail servers responsible for receiving emails for a domain.
    <br>
    - **TXT** Record: Holds text information, often used for SPF records, DKIM keys, and other text-based data.
    <br>
    - **SRV** Record (Service): Provides information about services available on a domain, such as VoIP or instant messaging.
    <br>
    - **NS** Record (Name Server): Specifies authoritative name servers for a domain.
    <br>
    - **PTR** Record (Pointer): Maps an IP address to a domain name, commonly used in reverse DNS lookups.
    <br>
    - **SOA** Record (Start of Authority): Contains administrative information about the domain, such as the primary name server and contact details.
    <br>
    - **CAA** Record (Certificate Authority Authorization): Specifies which certificate authorities are allowed to issue SSL certificates for a domain.
    <br><br>
These are just a few examples of the many DNS record types available, each serving a specific purpose in the domain name resolution process.
<br>

## Summary

In conclusion, the Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the backbone of the internet, facilitating seamless communication between devices through user-friendly domain names. This robust system operates on a hierarchical and distributed structure, enabling it to translate human-readable domain names into corresponding IP addresses and vice versa.
