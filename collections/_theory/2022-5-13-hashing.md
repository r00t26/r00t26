# Introduction
In our exploration of the digital landscape and pursuit of mastery, we must first unravel the mysteries of hashes, salts, and the intricate algorithms that safeguard our digital identities. Identifying these elusive algorithms is essential for those navigating the complexities of hacking and cybersecurity.
<br><br>
**Hashing** is a cryptic processâ€”**a one-way cryptographic function that transforms data into an unbreakable code**, preserving its integrity and confidentiality. Hashing is therefore used to protect passwords. Because hashing is non-reversible, it is impossible to determine the original clear-text value corresponding to a hash without knowing the original value and without employing intrusive techniques such as brute-forcing.
It is important not to get hashing confused with encryption. Encryption is a completely different cryptographic venture that we will delve into in another article. In the meantime, just remember that hashing is not encryption.

Hashing can also be used as a digital signature for files. What this means is that we can confirm the integrity of a file simply by checking its hash. In more simple terms, checking the file hash allows us to determine if a file has been tampered with in any way. Altering a file in even the slightest way like adding a single character, will completely change that files hash. I demonstrate this in the following image.

<br><br>
As you can see, I insert text into file.txt and check the file hash using the md5sum command. Then, I append more text to the file and check the hash once again. As we can see, the hash is completely different now.
On top of confirming a files integrity, **file signatures can also be used to identify known malicious files**. Online sources such as[**virustotal.com**](https://www.virustotal.com)allow you to paste in hashes to check if the given file hash corresponds to a known malicious file hash.

# Hashing Algorithms
At its core, a **hashing algorithm is a precise set of mathematical instructions meticulously designed to transform raw data into an indecipherable string known as a hash value**. This transformation is executed with surgical precision, resulting in a fixed-size string of characters that bears no resemblance to its original form. The resulting hash value acts as a digital fingerprint, a unique and immutable representation of the input data, essential for verification and authentication in the digital realm. 
<br><br>

There are various hashing algorithms out there, but the most common are detailed here.

<br>

- **MD5** : MD5 is a widely-used cryptographic hashing algorithm known for its simplicity and speed. However, it is vulnerable to collision attacks and is no longer recommended for cryptographic use. MD5 generates a 128-bit digest from a string of any length.
<br>**MD5 Hash Example**:
```

```
- **SHA1** : SHA-1 is a cryptographic hashing algorithm that generates a 160-bit hash value, typically represented as a 40-character hexadecimal string. It is widely used for digital signatures and integrity verification.
<br>**SHA1 Hash Example**:
```
40bd001563085fc35165329ea1ff5c5ecbdbbeef
```
- **SHA256** : SHA-256 is a member of the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hashing algorithms, known for its robust security and resistance to collision attacks. It generates a 256-bit hash value, typically represented as a 64-character hexadecimal string.
<br>**SHA256 Hash Example**:
```

```

Some hash algorithms are vulnerable to something known as a **collission attack**. This attack essentially means that **two differnet plaintext values can generate the same hash value**. MD5 and SHA1 are infamous for this as they are both vulnerable to collision attacks. SHA256 on the other hand is highly resistent to such attacks.



# Hash Salts
In the realm of cybersecurity, hash salts serve as essential safeguards against specific types of attacks such as rainbow tables, (*we will discuss rainbow tables in this article*). A hash salt is a random string of data that is combined with the plaintext password before hashing, creating a unique input for the hash function. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashed values will be different due to the inclusion of different salts.
<br>
The primary purpose of hash salts is to mitigate the risk of certain types of attacks, such as rainbow table attacks. Without a salt, identical plaintext passwords will produce the same hash value, making it easier for attackers to exploit pre-computed hash tables. By introducing a unique salt for each password, even identical plaintext passwords will produce different hash values, significantly enhancing security.


# Computing Hashes
Now let's take a look at how you can compute hashes yourself.
Most Linux distributions come with a suite of tools typically called hashing utilities or checksum utilities. This suite of tools contains commands that can be used to hash a given file or string. Let's look at some examples.

<br>

Computing a file's MD5 hash using md5sum:
```
md5sum file.txt
```
<br>

Computing a file's SHA1 hash using sha1sum:
```
sha1sum file.txt
```
<br>

Computing a file's SHA256 hash using sha256sum:
```
sha256sum file.txt
```
<br>

You can also pipe the output of echo into the hash sum command to hash the echoed string. For example:
```
echo -n "random string" | md5sum
```
